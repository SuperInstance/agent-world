// bots/src/api.js — the world's vocabulary, and the sandbox a skill runs in.
//
// A skill is a small JavaScript function. It may only use the words
// below, and it runs in a context that contains the words and nothing
// else.
//
// Three doors, in order of strength:
//
// 1. **The static door** (the Python side, `agent_world_reflex.door`):
//    a skill that names an unknown word, or reaches for `require` or
//    `process`, is refused before it ever enters the library.
// 2. **The parse door**: the body is compiled by Node's own parser.
// 3. **The runtime door** (this file): the skill runs in a `vm` context
//    that has no `require`, no `process`, no `Buffer`, no `console`, no
//    `eval`, and no `new Function` (string code generation is off). The
//    API wrappers are built *inside* the context, so even reaching for
//    their `constructor` lands in the sandbox's realm, not the host's.
//
// The low-level work — walking, pathing, aiming, mining — stays in
// mineflayer's own planners: `mineflayer-pathfinder` plans the walk and
// `bot.dig` does the mining. This file is the thin skin over them.

 * Find the nearest block of the given names, searching by block id.
 *
 * mineflayer's search has two paths. A function matcher makes it scan
 * the neighbourhood block by block — and that scan has a budget it
 * spends on the canopy around a builder standing in a tree before it
 * ever reaches the ground, so "no stone within 24 blocks" on a stone
 * mountainside (probe7). A list of block ids makes it ask each chunk's
 * own type index instead, which has no budget to spend and finds the
 * same blocks whatever is overhead. So the names are resolved to ids
 * and the level filter — a block the builder cannot reach is not a
