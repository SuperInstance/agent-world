// bots/src/humanity.js — the world's manners: how a builder behaves
// when a person is in it.
//
// Two things live here, and they are the two halves of the same rule:
//
// * **The commands.** A person may talk to the builders in chat, and a
//   short fixed list of phrases maps to goals ("follow me", "come
//   here") or to a skill asked for by family ("gather wood" is the
//   gatherer's wood skill, chosen through the reflex like any other
//   play). No model is on this path: the mapping is a table, so a
//   command lands in the same tick-budget as any other reflex choice.
//   Free text that matches no phrase is left alone (the mediator may
//   read it one day; it is not on the tick).
// * **The no-grief ledger.** Builders never break what a person placed,
//   never open a person's chest, never attack a player, and stay out of
//   a radius around a person's build unless invited. Nobody can watch
//   every block, so the ledger is the world's best knowledge: a block
//   that appears while a person is close enough to have placed it is
//   **theirs**, from then on. It is a heuristic — the server does not
//   say who placed a block — and it errs the only safe way: towards
//   protecting.
//
// What a person *says* is never written down (the kids' privacy rule).
// The log holds the command word and who answered it, never the free
// text around it.
