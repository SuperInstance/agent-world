// bots/src/agent.js — one builder in the world.
//
// A builder is a mineflayer client with a role. What it does is not up to
// it: every tick it tells the reflex what it can see and what it needs,
// and the reflex answers with one skill to do. The skill is a small
// JavaScript function from the library, it runs in the sandbox, and its
// outcome is measured against the prediction the skill made.
//
// Three things are worth noticing:
//
// * **The pathing is not the agent's.** The skill says *what* to do
//   ("mine that oak log"); mineflayer's own planners work out how to get
//   there. The reflex chooses the decision, not the footsteps.
// * **The measure is the skill's own prediction.** A skill says what it
//   expects to change; the world checks it. That is what makes a win rate
//   mean something.
// * **Nothing about a human is recorded.** The log holds decisions and
//   outcomes. Chat and audio are never stored.
